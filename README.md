This project explores a Car Sales dataset to analyze various attributes related to cars such as Year, Mileage, Price, Brand, Color, and Location. The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), uncover patterns in the data, and visualize key insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

-> Key Features:

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand its structure using functions like .head(), .info(), and .describe().
- Checked for missing values and duplicates in the dataset.
- Investigated categorical features such as Brand, Color, and Location to understand their distribution.

2. Data Visualization:
- Created multiple visualizations to display the distribution of important numerical features such as Price, Mileage, and Year using histograms and box plots.
- Visualized relationships between Mileage and Price, Year and Price, using seaborn and matplotlib to uncover any patterns.
- Used bar charts to show the frequency of categories like Brand, Model, Color, and Location.
- Analyzed and visualized the correlation between numerical variables.

3. Libraries Used:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and exploration.
- Matplotlib: For basic plotting of histograms, bar charts, and line plots.
- Seaborn: For creating more complex visualizations like pair plots and box plots.

4- Insights:
- The project offers a deeper look into car sales trends based on the car's production year, mileage, and price.
- Identified significant patterns such as the correlation between mileage and price, and how the year of manufacture influences the price of cars.
