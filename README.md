🚗 Car Sales Data Analysis & Visualization:

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of a used car dataset to uncover insights about car prices, production years, mileage, brand popularity, and more.

📌 Overview:

- Dataset: Car Data.csv
- Objective: Analyze trends in car sales data such as price distribution, brand/model frequency, location patterns, and relationships between numerical features.
- Tools Used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

⚙️ Analysis Workflow:

1- Data Loading & Initial Inspection:

- Load the dataset using pandas
- View data structure using .info(), .describe(), .head()
- Check for missing values and duplicate entries

2- Univariate Analysis:

- Frequency distributions of:
Car Brands
Models
Colors
Locations

- Histograms for:
Production Year
Mileage
Price

3- Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:

- Boxplots for Year, Mileage, and Price to detect outliers
- Barplots to explore relationships:
Mileage vs Price
Year vs Price
Pairplots to observe patterns between Year, Mileage, and Price

4- Visualization Highlights:

- Used matplotlib for bar plots and histograms
- Used seaborn for enhanced boxplots, barplots, and pairwise relationships.

📊 Visual Output Samples:

📉 Price Distribution
